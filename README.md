Project Description

The eclecticKitchen app will be for the aspiring cook that needs some help combining ingredients. The app will allow the user to make the most of the ingredients they already have at home. After they input the items they have, app will suggest dishes they can make using the ingredients at home. 

User Story

As a novice culinary enthusiasts, I want to have a recipe generator that created recipes based on the items I have so that I can make full restaurant quality meals at home on a budget.  

User Flow

1. Input the ingredients in your fridge, then recommended recipes utilizing your ingredients will appear on the left menu. 

2. Click a dish on the left menu to have recipe details load to the middle section. 

3. You can save the listed missing ingredients for next grocery shopping

4. You will have a link to connect, through google, to the original recipe page to view cooking details.

5. You can save ingredients in the 'My fridge' section(local storage) and automatically fill out the search box next time by clicking a button.
